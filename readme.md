# Python-FedEx API
## Summary

This is a module which I've developed to simplify interfacing with the FedEx API.

To use this module, you will need to register for a FedEx Developer account and obtain an API and a Secret Key.

Additionally, this is not meant to be security-hardened module. It is only used for internal business processes. Use at your own risk.
